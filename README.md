Fastbill Automatic
==================

This is a fork of the well known fastbill-automatic gem, which was originally developed by reputami (link: https://github.com/reputami/fastbill-automatic). However since this gem lacks some comfort when accessing some attributes of certain models I decided to add them myself. See the original readme for some hints how to use this gem.
